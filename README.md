# Psyrian Iteration 1

## About

Psyrian is a small space shooter inspired by Tyrian 2000, a game published by Epic MegaGames that was rereleased as freeware in 2007.

Once you are in the level, the controls are as follows:

- Up, Down, Left, Right: Move
- Space: Fire weapon
  
Score as many points as you can!

## Reflection

This first portion of the assignment came with a lot of hiccups as I moved forward, but that's to be expected. Using projects definitely helped me feel like I always had a gameplan moving forward and I never felt like I was wasting time as I worked on my project because of that. To me, that's one of the best parts of working in a sprint, and I know we didn't call it that at the beginning of the final, but that's really what it is.

One issue I ran into this iteration was time; I had to spend a lot of my time on other projects or on work, and this class became an afterthought. This was especially with the election being on my mind consistently through the week. However, now at the end of the iteration, I'm very happy with what I've been able to put together and I feel like I have a really strong foundation for adding features and content in the next two iterations. I'll be planning them out on the projects tomorrow and making sure I give myself enough time to hit roadblocks early on this time.
